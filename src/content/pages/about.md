This site is built with [Muul](https://github.com/ak0r/muul) — a minimal Astro blog template.

## What this place is

A place for writing. The structure is intentionally simple: posts, tags, and an about page. Nothing else earns its place here unless it serves the writing.

## The template

Muul is built on [Astro](https://astro.build) with [Oat.ink](https://oat.ink) as the base styling layer. No Tailwind, no heavy frameworks, no build complexity. The font stack is deliberate. The colour palette is Flexoki-inspired. The theme toggle respects your system preference and remembers your choice.

If you're reading this in a fork of the template, update this page. Make it yours.

## Get in touch

Links are in the footer. That's intentional too.
